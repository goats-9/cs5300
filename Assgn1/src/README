This zip archive contains a source code that implements various multi-threaded
solutions in C++ to count the sparsity of a matrix. The sparsity of a matrix is
defined as the number of zero entries in it.

Compile the source code by running the following command.

    g++ -O3 -std=c++20 Assgn1-Src-CS21BTECH11018.cpp

To run the generated executable, issue the following command.

    ./a.out

A dialog showing the required options will be displayed. Use the appropriate
options for employing the right technique to compute the sparsity of the matrix.
